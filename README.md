# Mini-SGLang

A **lightweight yet high-performance** inference framework for Large Language Models.

---

Mini-SGLang is a compact implementation of [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), designed to demystify the complexities of modern LLM serving systems. With a compact codebase of **~5,000 lines of Python**, it serves as both a capable inference engine and a transparent reference for researchers and developers.

## ✨ Key Features

- **High Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art throughput and latency with advanced optimizations.
- **Lightweight & Readable**: A clean, modular, and fully type-annotated codebase that is easy to understand and modify.
- **Advanced Optimizations**:
  - **Radix Cache**: Reuses KV cache for shared prefixes across requests.
  - **Chunked Prefill**: Reduces peak memory usage for long-context serving.
  - **Overlap Scheduling**: Hides CPU scheduling overhead with GPU computation.
  - **Tensor Parallelism**: Scales inference across multiple GPUs.
  - **Optimized Kernels**: Integrates **FlashAttention** and **FlashInfer** for maximum efficiency.
  - ...

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **⚠️ Platform Support**: Mini-SGLang currently supports **Linux only** (x86_64 and aarch64). Windows and macOS are not supported due to dependencies on Linux-specific CUDA kernels (`sgl-kernel`, `flashinfer`). We recommend using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows or Docker for cross-platform compatibility.

### 1. Environment Setup

We recommend using `uv` for a fast and reliable installation (note that `uv` does not conflict with `conda`).

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10+ recommended)
uv venv --python=3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

cd /path/to/ICS

conda create -n minisgl python=3.12 pip setuptools wheel -y
conda activate minisgl

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install torch-c-dlpack-ext



**Prerequisites**: Mini-SGLang relies on CUDA kernels that are JIT-compiled. Ensure you have the **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** installed and that its version matches your driver's version. You can check your driver's CUDA capability with `nvidia-smi`.

### 2. Installation

Install Mini-SGLang directly from the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/mini-sglang.git
cd mini-sglang && uv venv --python=3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

#### Build KTransformers

KTransformers is pinned as a Git submodule under `third_party/ktransformers`.
For a fresh checkout of this repository, use `git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>`.
To initialize an existing checkout (including KT's nested dependencies), run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For later updates, run `git pull --recurse-submodules` followed by
`git submodule update --init --recursive` if new submodules were introduced.
This uses the commits pinned by the parent repositories, not upstream branch tips.
Build and install the local `kt-kernel` on Linux from the repository root with:

```bash
cd third_party/ktransformers/kt-kernel
CPUINFER_USE_CUDA=1 bash install.sh
cd ../../..
```

The KV–MoE work currently targets a single GPU running Qwen3-30B-A3B.
`coldest_experts.txt` is the ordered eviction allowlist; the initial policy has
no cumulative-frequency limit and exposes `check_stop_moe_eviction()` for later changes.
Restoration is eager: once both regions belonging to an offloaded expert have
released their final KV references, restore that expert immediately, regardless
of global pressure or profile order. Prefix-cache references count as live KV.

Enable the implementation with `--expert-profile coldest_experts.txt`. This selects
pointer-table attention, decode CUDA graphs, overlap scheduling, and KT's BF16 CPU
backend (AMX when supported, otherwise KT's AVX2 backend). Decode captures both a
pure-GPU graph and a hybrid graph: the fast graph has no KT host callbacks, while
the hybrid graph reads fixed-address CPU/GPU expert masks at replay time. Expert
eviction and restoration therefore do not require graph recapture. Residency
transitions synchronize with outstanding engine work before a weight buffer changes
ownership; batches without a transition retain normal overlap scheduling.
CPU/GPU expert computation still overlaps within each MoE forward. Use Linux,
Python 3.11+, CUDA toolkit, PyTorch 2.9.1 and the pinned KT source above.

Set `--cuda-graph-max-bs` at least as high as the decode batch sizes being benchmarked.
For example, `--max-running-requests 256 --cuda-graph-max-bs 8` runs batches above 8
eagerly and is not a valid graph-on versus graph-off throughput comparison.

For the short end-to-end demo, run `bash scripts/demo_kv_moe.sh /path/to/Qwen3-30B-A3B`,
then `python scripts/check_kv_moe.py` in another terminal. The small persistent
pool forces expert eviction; `--cache-type naive` lets completed requests release
all KV so eager restoration is visible. Radix prefix caching is also supported,
but cached prefixes retain KV ownership until evicted.

See [the implementation report](docs/kv_moe_implementation.md) for changes and validation.

<summary><b>💡 Installing on Windows (WSL2)</b></summary>

Since Mini-SGLang requires Linux-specific dependencies, Windows users should use WSL2:

1. **Install WSL2** (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell (as Administrator)
   wsl --install
   ```

2. **Install CUDA on WSL2**:
   - Follow [NVIDIA's WSL2 CUDA guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html)
   - Ensure your Windows GPU drivers support WSL2

3. **Install Mini-SGLang in WSL2**:
   ```bash
   # Inside WSL2 terminal
   git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/mini-sglang.git
   cd mini-sglang && uv venv --python=3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Access from Windows**: The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` from Windows browsers and applications.

<details>
<summary><b>🐳 Running with Docker</b></summary>

**Prerequisites**:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t minisgl .
   ```

2. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all -p 1919:1919 \
       minisgl --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

3. **Run in interactive shell mode**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --gpus all \
       minisgl --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --shell
   ```

4. **Using Docker Volumes for persistent caches** (recommended for faster subsequent startups):
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all -p 1919:1919 \
       -v huggingface_cache:/app/.cache/huggingface \
       -v tvm_cache:/app/.cache/tvm-ffi \
       -v flashinfer_cache:/app/.cache/flashinfer \
       minisgl --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

</details>

### 3. Online Serving

Launch an OpenAI-compatible API server with a single command.

```bash
# Deploy Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B on a single GPU
python -m minisgl --model "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"

# Deploy meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct on 4 GPUs with Tensor Parallelism, on port 30000
python -m minisgl --model "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct" --tp 4 --port 30000
```

Once the server is running, you can send requests using standard tools like `curl` or any OpenAI-compatible client.

### 4. Interactive Shell

Chat with your model directly in the terminal by adding the `--shell` flag.

```bash
python -m minisgl --model "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B" --shell
```

![shell-example](https://lmsys.org/images/blog/minisgl/shell.png)

You can also use `/reset` to clear the chat history.
